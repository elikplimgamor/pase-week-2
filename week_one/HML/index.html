        <h2>THE CONTRIBUTION OF TRICYCLE MOTOR TAXIS TO  SOCIO-ECONOMIC LIFE IN WA MUNICIPALITY</h2>
        <p>Transport is an important element in development and it affords the social, economic
             and political interaction that most people take for granted (Button and Hensher, 2001). 
             According to Romanus D. Dinye (2014), the provision of transport infrastructure has grown extensively
              across the globe through a range of networks of modes which have undergone technological
             improvements cutting across the motive power, the tracks and the means that serve as compartment 
             for passengers and goods. Personal mobility is one of democracy’s most valued freedoms and it is,
            therefore, not surprising that a high proportion of man’s income is devoted to the movement of the
             goods and transactions. <blockquote> importance to the socio economic, political and cultural development 
             of any nation is underscored by Munby’s (1968) statement that “there is no escape from transport”.</blockquote> 
             A good transport system is vital to the development of any country; this shows the important role that
             transportation plays in the development of every society, whether it is a developed, developing or 
             under-developed nation. According to Rodrigue et al (2013), when transport systems are efficient, 
             economic and social opportunities benefits that result in positive multiplier effects such as better 
             accessibility to markets, employment and additional investments are created.

        <h2>THE CANVAS</h2>
        <P>
            The frst component we’ll defne is the part of the interface that displays the
            picture as a grid of colored boxes. This component is responsible for two things:
            showing a picture and communicating pointer events on that picture to the rest
            of the application.
            As such, we can defne it as a component that knows about only the current
            picture, not the whole application state. Because it doesn’t know how the
            application as a whole works, it cannot directly dispatch actions. Rather,
            when responding to pointer events, it calls a callback function provided by the
            code that created it, which will handle the application-specifc parts
        </P>

        <h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
        <p>
            We will use the browser DOM to display the game, and we’ll read user input
            by handling key events.
            The screen- and keyboard-related code is only a small part of the work we
            need to do to build this game. Since everything looks like colored boxes, drawing is uncomplicated: we create DOM elements and use styling to give them a
            background color, size, and position.
            We can represent the background as a table since it is an unchanging grid of
            squares. The free-moving elements can be overlaid using absolutely positioned
            elements.
            In games and other programs that should animate graphics and respond
            to user input without noticeable delay, efciency is important. Although the
            DOM was not originally designed for high-performance graphics, it is actually
            better at this than you would expect. You saw some animations in Chapter
            14. On a modern machine, a simple game like this performs well, even if we
            don’t worry about optimization very much.
            In the next chapter, we will explore another browser technology, the 
            tag, which provides a more traditional way to draw graphics, working in terms
            of shapes and pixels rather than DOM elements.
